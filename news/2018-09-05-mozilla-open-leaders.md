I was accepted to participate in the [Mozilla Open Leaders Program Cohort 6](https://medium.com/mozilla-festival/meet-our-next-cohort-of-open-leaders-15241fe6cc64).  I will be working on a project inspired by my teaching with the Carpentries and my own challenges in learning to package my python projects: [ Good Enough Open Source Practices for Data Analysis in Python](https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-6/issues/16).
