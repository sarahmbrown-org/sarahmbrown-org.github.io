I presented a workshop at [NSBE's 44th Annual Convention](http://convention.nsbe.org/) on [Data visualization and management](https://kariljordan.github.io/2018-03-22-NSBE/) using an [excerpt](http://sarahmbrown.org/python-ecology-mini/) of the [Data Carpentry Python Ecology Lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/). The post workshop content is [available on github](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-ecology-files/tree/postnsbe). Dr. Kari Jordan, of Data Carpentry co-facilitated the workshop with me and a special thanks to Dr. Christan Grant for helping others troubleshoot as well.
