# CMU ML Lunch
I gave at talk at the [Carnegie Mellon University machine learning lunch](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~learning/).  I talked about work in progress to elicit priors inspired by grad student descent experiences during my PhD and our upcoming [FLAIRS paper](../files/dsp_paper.pdf)- plus the work we're doing to extend it.
