# Funded UTRA

Two Brown undergraduates, [Jessica Dai](http://www.jessicadai.com/) and Pazia Bermudez-Silverman will work with me this fall funded through an [Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/fellowships/utra/recipients) on our project, "Examining Fairness Interventions in Machine Learning: Empirical Validation and Social Grounding"
