# NSBE-BAI Pathways into AI

I'm speaking on a panel hosted by [Black in AI](https://blackinai.github.io/) on Pathways into AI at the National Society of Black Engineers 45th Annual Convention in Detroit, MI on March 28. Join us to learn about how to get into the feild of AI and see how many different ways fellow NSBE members have made our way there.
