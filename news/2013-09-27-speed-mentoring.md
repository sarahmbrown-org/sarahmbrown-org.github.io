I served as a speed mentor for the Black Engineering Student Society at Northeastern tonight-- a component of their retention program where underclassmen got to have four, 5 minute speed mentoring sessions with upperclassmen & alumni. Â Giving back always makes me so much more motivated to do my own work!
