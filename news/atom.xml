&lt;p&gt;Lani will be working on understanding how problem formulation is/not described in current
ML research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor and Noah will be joining Brendan to work on internal tooling for the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;title&lt;/strong&gt;  Data Science Skills in Unexpected Places&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;abstract&lt;/strong&gt; Data science is a highly interdisciplinary pursuit, combining computer science and statistics with domain expertise to make sense of data. This means as data scientists we must work closely with domain experts or develop enough domain expertise of our own for each project.  In this talk, I will share the story behind a few data science projects I have done: how high school social studies helped me develop a learning PTSD diagnosis, undergraduate advanced writing helps me measure understanding of fairness in AI, and how student leadership experiences help me design tools for data scientists to build better models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
