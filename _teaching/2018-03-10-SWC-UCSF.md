title: Software Carpentry Workshop at UCSF
---

I taught the python sections of the two day Software Carpentry workshop hosted by the [UCSF Library March 10-11, 2018](https://gboushey.github.io/2017-03-10-UCSF-Python/).  

I used the [SWC Python Gapminder](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) curriculum with [minor modifications to emphasize extra features of jupyter notebooks](http://sarahmbrown.org/python-novice-gapminder/).  I used github to manage the student downloads (by .zip files) and the [final post workshop content](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-novice-gapminder-files/tree/ucsfpostworkshop) and [documented the process](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-novice-gapminder-files/blob/master/instructor_resources/create_workshop_branch.ipynb) I used to for setup with this jupyter notebook.
