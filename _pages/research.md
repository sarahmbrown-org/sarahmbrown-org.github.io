I am making AI more fair by enabling it to use subjective human expertise. I do this by modeling bias in the world, understanding the behavior of fair machine learning interventions, and building tools that directly allow domain experts to interact with data and learning systems. Through collaborations with social scientists who study societal bias, I am able to develop better models that can aid in detection of biases in datasets and prevent machines from replicating those biases. To understand where different types of interventions succeed and fail, I analyzed the behavior of fair machine learning algorithms. Finally, I collaboratively build tools that enable incorporating expertise and subjective assessments of data in the modeling process.  Underlying all of these is a core technical approach of probabilistic model-based machine learning. I trained in developing probabilistic models for complex systems with multiple sources of uncertainty by collaborating with affective neuroscientists improving understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity that create emotional experiences.
