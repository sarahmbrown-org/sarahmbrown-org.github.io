I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and director of the [ML4STS Lab](https://ml4sts.com/) at the University of Rhode Island.
Previously I was a [Data Science Initiative](https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/data-science/) Postdoc at Brown University affiliated to the Division of Applied Mathematics and hosted by Professor Bjorn Sandstede and I completed a [Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/programs-services/postdoctoral/about-cpfp) in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley with faculty mentor Professor [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I completed a BS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering in 2011 a MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a  PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2016 advised by [Jennifer Dy](http://www.ece.neu.edu/fac-ece/jdy/) both at Northeastern University. My graduate studies were supported by a Draper Laboratory Fellowship and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My other professional activities include teaching computational data analysis skills to researchers with The Carpentries and serving as the treasurer emeritus on the Women in Machine Learning, Inc Senior Advisory Council.
