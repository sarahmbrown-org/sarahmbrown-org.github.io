As founding chair through 2015, I lead a team of students to work with the Engineering Dean's office to increase student engagement in research, specifically undergraduate involvement and graduate ownership, within the college by providing resources and hosting educational workshops.  Some of our most successful initiatives include a workshop for students applying to Research Experience for Undergraduates programs, a college wide undergraduate lab fair, and an experimental design workshop for engineering graduate students.
