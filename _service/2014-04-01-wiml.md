In 2016 I joined the WiML Board, I currently serve as the Treasurer.
I served as a co-organizer for the 2014 [Women in Machine Learning Workshop](http://www.wimlworkshop.org/).  The 9th Annual WiML was again co-located with [NIPS](http://nips.cc).  As the Finance and Sponsorship chair, I lead our efforts to secure corporate sponsorship and our sponsor relations.
