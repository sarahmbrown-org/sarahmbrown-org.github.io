excerpt: From 2016-2019 I was a WiML Board member, serving as treasurer.

In 2016 I joined the WiML Board, I served as the Treasurer from 2016 until March 2019. In this capacity, I formalized our financial practices, built a finance committee, and established a direct funding for general administrative support.
I served as a co-organizer for the 2014 [Women in Machine Learning Workshop](http://www.wimlworkshop.org/).  The 9th Annual WiML was again co-located with [NeurIPS](http://nips.cc).  As the Finance and Sponsorship chair, I lead our efforts to secure corporate sponsorship and our sponsor relations.
