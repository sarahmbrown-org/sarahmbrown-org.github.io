title: Choosing Open and Initial Reflections on Open Leadership
categories:

Working more openly has been a goal of mine for a while, but I've struggled.  I love the idea, but I was not well versed in the practices. I want to support open scientific practice and to share work. I believe that working open will facilitate better, faster science.  I struggled though because figuring out the line as to when to open things or how much to open and to protect getting credit for my work.  I struggled because I wasn't sure how the essential tools worked.  I struggled because I am not well versed in a lot of the infrastructure that was expected of the projects and in order to contribute to them. It felt like too much overhead. I have spent some time on projects where it wasn't fully supported and others where it was strictly not allowed. I am free of those constraints now.  


## Choosing Open

I made my [first pull request](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/8548) during the UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science Docathon last year. Later I joined the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) as an instructor, a process that required a lesson contribution pull request.  I've since made a number of other lesson contributions and joined the [lesson infrastructure committee](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-infrastructure/) where I'm learning more about how to manage a complex network of open source curriculum.  Late last year I published a [complete repo](https://github.com/fairnessforensics/detect_simpsons_paradox/) to accompany a paper, [documentation](https://fairnessforensics.github.io/detect_simpsons_paradox/html/index.html) and all.

I have gradually been choosing to work open increasingly often, but there are some aspects that I still struggle with.  Learning is always better with a community and tangible goals, so I took the leap to propose a project to the [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) program. My project was [accepted](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-6/projects/projects---cohort-a/)! I've decided that learning to lead open and facilitating a project through open source growth is a good accountability mechanism to getting back to blogging as well. I'm hoping to not only work openly in the formal sense, the product that I'm working to build, but to share this experience and be open about how I'm learning.

## Leading Open

The Mozilla Open leaders Program got off to a really fast start. I found out my project was accepted September 5 and I had the first call with my mentor on September 11. On the first call we reviewed the results of a leadership inventory. This reflective exercise made me realize that a lot of my leadership strategies in various organizations.  Documenting the work and the status of it and opening up for increase collaboration are strategies I have tried to get my teams to follow in other contexts.

I look forward to learning more about leading this type of project in order to increase my work this way and to bring these practices in


## misc

I am excited to join the MOozilla Open Leaders Cohort Six.  This is about learning to work open.  That primarily means in th open source sense, but I am also aiming to write about the process and open up about my thinking as I go though the program. I found out I was accpeted to the program while I was travelingn and barely got to thin through the beginning. I was accepted on a Wednesday after I had just finihsed teaching a pilot session on the content that I had proposed to develop witht he support ofthe program.  I really was going to work onhis mno matter what.

I did an open session.  

Here are the materials that I had ad that point  I also makde this a benchmark so I canc easily refelct on the progress I makd through te course of the program.  I wnt to think abut this ften.

I had my first mentor call while I was there as well.  Six days ater being accepted, the progrem started actively.  I think that was fast.  What twas excited was tht my mentor is a part othe progrram that inspried me to create the content.  I am an instructore with the carpentreis.  and so is my mentor.  I iwas inpsired to create this because of thwa ti felt we dont quite get people ready to to within the two day workshops the carpetnersis host.
