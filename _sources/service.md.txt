# Service

Outside of the lab, I am a passionate advocate for underrepresented STEM engagement at all levels. After a three year term as treasurer of Women In Machine Learning, Inc, I have moved to the senior advisory council. As a student, I held a variety of leadership positions in the National Society of Black Engineers at both the local and national levels including National Academic Excellence Chair.
