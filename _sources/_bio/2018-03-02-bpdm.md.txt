Dr. Sarah Brown is a University of California, Berkeley Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Dr. Brown received her BS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering in May 2011 magna cum laude, MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering in January 2014, and PhD in Electrical Engineering in December 2016, all from Northeastern University.  Her graduate studies were supported by a Draper Laboratory Fellowship and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.   Dr. Brown’s research interests are in the design and analysis of machine learning methods under extreme uncertainty conditions.  For example, how to model experimental data when ground truth is unknown or how to assess fairness of an algorithm when the bias in the data is not well understood quantitatively. Outside of the lab, Sarah is a passionate advocate for underrepresented STEM engagement at all levels. Currently she serves as treasurer for Women In Machine Learning and general co-chair of the Broadening Participation in Datamining Program. As a student, Sarah served in a various roles in the National Society of Black Engineers at both the local and national levels.
