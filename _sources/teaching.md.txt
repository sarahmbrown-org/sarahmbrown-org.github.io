# Teaching

In my teaching, I aim to engage learners in a conversation about the material. I take care to practice the strategies for creating an inclusive computer science learning environment I learned in the [Carpentries instructor Training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

Programming for Data Science Fall
^^^
[Fall 2021 course site](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/)  

In teaching CSC/DSP310 the second time, I made minor revisions to reinforce understanding for students through:

- more code inspection  
- more authentic tasks in assignments

[Fall 2020 course site](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/)

In teaching CSC/DSP310 the first time, I made major revisions to a more learner-centric format:

- participatory live coding instruction  
- mastery based  grading  
- more, smaller assignments

Software Carpentry Workshop at UCSF
^^^

I taught the python sections of the two day Software Carpentry workshop hosted by the [UCSF Library March 10-11, 2018](https://gboushey.github.io/2017-03-10-UCSF-Python/).  

I used the [SWC Python Gapminder](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) curriculum with [minor modifications to emphasize extra features of jupyter notebooks](http://sarahmbrown.org/python-novice-gapminder/).  I used github to manage the student downloads (by .zip files) and the [final post workshop content](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-novice-gapminder-files/tree/ucsfpostworkshop) and [documented the process](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-novice-gapminder-files/blob/master/instructor_resources/create_workshop_branch.ipynb) I used to for setup with this jupyter notebook.

Bayesian Nonparametric Guest Lectures
^^^
I guest lectured in my PhD adviser Jennifer Dy's graduate machine learning course. I taught two lectures, the first introducing bayesian nonparamerics with the Dirichlet Process/ Chinese Restaurant Process and the second extending to the Indian Buffet Process.

Materials:
 - [Part 1 slides](files/bnp_lecture1_2015.pdf)
