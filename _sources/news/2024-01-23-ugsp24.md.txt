# Welcome to new undergraduates Lani, Noah,  Trevor, and Rohan

Lani will be working on understanding how problem formulation is/not described in current 
ML research. 

Trevor and Noah will be joining Brendan to work on internal tooling for the lab.

Rohan will be working on simulating biased data to be able to better characterize when fairness intervetions succeed and fail to mitigate biases.
