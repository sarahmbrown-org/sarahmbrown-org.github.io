# CarpentryCon 2018

I'm giving a talk and presenting a poster on using `load` magic in Jupyter notebooks for teaching with the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and how we could better organize curriculum to support this teaching style at  [CarpentryCon](http://www.carpentrycon.org/) in Dublin.  The [slides](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/Sessions/2018-05-30/08-Lightning-Talks-Session-2/brown-slides.pdf) and [poster](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/Sessions/2018-05-30/08-Lightning-Talks-Session-2/brown-poster.pdf) are both available on the conference [Github repository](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon).
