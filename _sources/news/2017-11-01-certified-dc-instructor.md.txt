# Data Carpentry Certified Instructor

Now that I've received my certificate, it's official, I'm a Data Carpentry instructor.  To do this, I completed a two day [training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/pull/216) to a Data Carpentry lesson, and passed a teaching demonstration.  

Now I'm ready to teach and working on planning one for [#NSBE44](http://convention.nsbe.org/)
