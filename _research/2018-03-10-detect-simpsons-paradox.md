Simpson’s paradox is the phenomenon that a trend of an association
in the whole population reverses within the subpopulations
defined by a categorical variable. Detecting Simpson’s
paradox indicates surprising and interesting patterns of
the data set for the user. It is generally discussed in terms of
binary variables, but studies for the exploration of it for continuous
variables are relatively rare. This paper describes a
method to discover Simpson’s paradox for the trend of the
pair of continuous variables
